# Weather APP

## ‚ú® The project :
This project is part of an assignment for the **Web Development 1** module. The goal is to create a fully functional web app, that provides weather data for cities , display the weather and forecast for the next 7 days for cities. 
This project showcases a responsive and minimalist layout with engaging UI elements.
The focus of this assignment is to apply fundamental web development concepts, including:  
- **HTML5** for structuring content  
- **Bulma** (CSS) framewokr for styling and layout 
- **JavaScript** for the app functionality logic  
-**Eleventy** HTML template

### üéì What I Learned :
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:  

- **Crafting well-structured web pages** using semantic HTML elements  
- **Utilizing Bulma** to create modern, responsive UI components  
- **Simulating API data locally** using a custom JSON-based data structure served on **localhost**  
- **Storing and accessing weather data** through a local data source to replicate real-world API integration

## ‚ú® Key Features  
- Fully responsive layout tailored for both mobile and desktop experiences  
- Stylish interface built with Bulma, offering a clean and modern look  
- Data-driven weather interface powered by a local JSON-based API  

### üåç Main Dashboard  
- Presents weather summaries for multiple global cities  
- Interactive cards: selecting a city navigates to a detailed view  
- Highlights a personalized list of favorite cities based on user preferences  

### üå¶Ô∏è City Weather View
